            With just a thought in mind to deliver with creativity and the taste
            Burger lovers crave, we started with a simple take away outlet at
            Khayaban-e-Rahat in Karachi.
          </p>
          <p>
            From introducing the American burger smash technique into the
            market, serving delicious mouth-watering burgers with saucy and
            scrumptious fries, we’re doing it all!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our key to success has solely been innovating and experimenting,
            living up to our name "RHINO_DAIZO".
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing to 32 outlets across 9 cities in Pakistan in just 10 years,
            the brand has become a household name.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long from now, we wish to establish it in the near future as an
            International Burger Franchise.
